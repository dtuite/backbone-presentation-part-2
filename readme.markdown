## Talk about this stuff

**Last month**

 - Looked at 3 of the 4 main Backbone objects
 - Defined a Todo model
 - Created a collection of Todos in the console and rendered them on the page
 - Talked about adding listeners to views so they update themselves when
   model data changes

**What we want to cover this month**

 * Sync, View Events, Validations, Routers
 * Show the finished Todo app
 * Quickly run through (the stripped) Todo.js with a foray into the localstorage file

**View Events**  

 - Add the createOnEnter event to the app view
 - Add the removal event to the todoView
 - Remember to bind to the events
 - Add the toggle event to the todoView

**Validations**

 - Add validation to the todo model along with a method to handle it

**Routing**

 - Create a router for the app
 - Create a second route which takes a param

**Finish**
