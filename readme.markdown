## Talk about this stuff

**Last month**

 - Looked at 3 of the 4 main Backbone objects
 - Defined a Todo model
 - Created a collection of Todos in the console and rendered them on the page
 - Talked about adding listeners to views so they update themselves when
   model data changes

**What we want to cover this month**

  * Sync, View Events, Validations, Routers
  * Show the finished Todo app
  * Quickly run through Todo.js with a foray into the localstorage file

**View Events**
